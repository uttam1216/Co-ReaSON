To adhere to data sharing, we cannot share our exact notebook with all results. 
So, we share one of the result's screenshot. Upon request other arrangements can be made to show other results as we describe in our reasearch work.
Currently we show CoReaSON_8sec.png (results of the seizure onset detection made utilizing all 8 sec time interval multivariate EEG)
